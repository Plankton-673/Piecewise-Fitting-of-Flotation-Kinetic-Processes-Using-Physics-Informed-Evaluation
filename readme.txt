	The conventional process of reaction kinetics assumes that the time derivative of the recovery rate is in a power relationship with the proportion of the reactive part in the system, which constitutes the differential power equation of reaction kinetics based on time for recovery rate. The implicit expression of the differential equation makes it impossible for conventional parameter fitting methods to calculate the numerical residuals of the equation and achieve least squares estimation. Therefore, traditional reaction kinetics process fitting often requires pre assumptions about the power of the differential equation (i.e. reaction order), which leads to distortion in some kinetic process predictions. We considered directly using optimizer for iterative fitting and segmenting the function and introducing ODE estimation for fitting.
	
	We provide two runnable MATLAB examples The file 'open_comcess-direct. m' is an example of direct numerical fitting without segmentationâ€˜ The 'open_capts_ODE.Average. m' file is an example of segmenting and introducing ODE evaluation.
